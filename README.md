- [Less](https://lesscss.org/) - Leaner Style Sheets

### What I learned

While working through this project, firstly I have learnt Less.js features likes (variables, mixins, nesting). It was fun writing css using less and I have more control over my css class and properties. Secondly, I gained some experinece and basic knowledge about Figma UI design tool.

### Useful resources

- [LESSCSS](https://lesscss.org/) - Official website for Less.js.
- [Figma | Dev Mode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/) - This article helped me understand how to work with figma files from you VSCode. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
